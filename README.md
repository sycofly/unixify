- **Membership Management**: Assign users to appropriate groups with validation
- **Search Functionality**: Find accounts and groups by UID, username, GID, or groupname
- **Audit Logging**: Track all changes with detailed audit entries
- **Soft Deletion**: Preserve data integrity with soft delete for accounts and groups
- **UID/GID Validation**: Enforce proper UID/GID ranges for different account types
- **RESTful API**: Comprehensive API for programmatic access
- **Containerization**: Docker and Podman support for easy deployment

## üìã Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or higher
- PostgreSQL 16 or higher
- Podman or Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using Docker/Podman

The fastest way to get started is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/home/unixify.git
cd unixify

# Start the application and database
docker-compose up -d
```

Then access the web interface at http://localhost:8080

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/home/unixify.git
   cd unixify
   ```

2. Create and configure the environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database settings
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   make migrate-up
   ```

4. Build and run:
   ```bash
   make build
   make run
   ```

5. Access the web interface at http://localhost:8080

## üìä Database Schema

The application uses the following database schema:

- **accounts**: User accounts with UIDs, usernames, and types
- **groups**: Groups with GIDs, groupnames, and types
- **account_groups**: Many-to-many relationship between accounts and groups
- **audit_entries**: Comprehensive audit log for all system actions

## üîç UID and GID Ranges

The application enforces the following UID and GID ranges:

| Type     | UID/GID Range | Description                                |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| People   | 1000-60000    | Regular user accounts and groups           |
| System   | 1-999         | System accounts and groups                 |
| Service  | 60001-65535   | Service accounts and application services  |
| Database | 70000-79999   | Database users and related groups          |
